# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: November 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Introduction to TensorFlow and Tensors, explored it's basics operations: creation, evaluating and shaping.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with TensorFlow, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Tensors is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: November 29, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Introduction to Lenear Regression, line of best-fit, Data, Visualizing Data, Training vs Testing Datasets and conversion of categorical data into numeric type using TensorFlow tool.

**Thoughts:** I struggled a little with some TF tools, but I figured out the flow. Overall, It was really good learning, I enjoyed it.

### Day2: November 30, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Training Process, Epochs, Overfitting, Input Function, Creating Model, Training Model and Making Prediction using model, that means I finished the Linear Regression Part.

**Thoughts:** It was seemingly complicated to understand the Input Function, but I am on track. Other's were easy, I enjoyed coding.

### Day3: December 1, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Overviewed to Classification, explored Iris dataset, followed the process as in Regression: created train and test datasets, explored daa, created Input Function, created Feature column, built a model, train model and test model. One new thing was choosing a classifier, chose as suggested DNNClassifier(Deep Neural Network) over LinearClassifier. And yeah, 'steps' for training data, last time we used 'epochs' in Regression.

**Thoughts:** It's still hard for me to understand the Input Function, but I am learning. Other's were easy and enjoying.

### Day4: December 2, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Finished Clustering part, explored Clustering Concepts: Centroids, Euclidean Distance/Manhatten Distance, Center of Mass, KMeans Algorithm for clustering. Finished Hidden Markov Model part: explored Probablity Distribution, Stetes-Observation-Transition(components of HMM), Observation-Transition Probablity, set-up for Markov Model, created Weather Model as given in TensorFlow official docs, Evaluted the model.

**Thoughts:** There's problem in Tensorflow 2, so we need to write KMeans Clustering algorithms from scratch, so just explored theritically, and also because of upgraded version of Tensorflow we needed "tensorflow_probablity" to be upgraded. These were the kind of new, but other's were worked out. I am okay, I am enjoying.

### Day5: December 3, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Overviewed the the Neutral Network basics. Topics Covered: Neural Network Intro, Input Layer, Hidden Layer, Output Layer, Weights, Bias, Activation Function(Rectified Linear Unit:Relu, Hyperbolic Tangent: Tanh and Sigmoid), Loss/Cost Function and Gradient Descent.

**Thoughts:** Activation Function, Loss Function, Gradient Descend, these were the hard topic to understand, but still I'm making my way. Its a Tubular day !!
