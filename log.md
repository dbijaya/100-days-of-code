# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: November 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Introduction to TensorFlow and Tensors, explored it's basics operations: creation, evaluating and shaping.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with TensorFlow, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Tensors is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: November 29, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Introduction to Lenear Regression, line of best-fit, Data, Visualizing Data, Training vs Testing Datasets and conversion of categorical data into numeric type using TensorFlow tool.

**Thoughts:** I struggled a little with some TF tools, but I figured out the flow. Overall, It was really good learning, I enjoyed it.

### Day2: November 30, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Training Process, Epochs, Overfitting, Input Function, Creating Model, Training Model and Making Prediction using model, that means I finished the Linear Regression Part.

**Thoughts:** It was seemingly complicated to understand the Input Function, but I am on track. Other's were easy, I enjoyed coding.

### Day3: December 1, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Overviewed to Classification, explored Iris dataset, followed the process as in Regression: created train and test datasets, explored daa, created Input Function, created Feature column, built a model, train model and test model. One new thing was choosing a classifier, chose as suggested DNNClassifier(Deep Neural Network) over LinearClassifier.

**Thoughts:** It's still hard for me to understand the Input Function, but I am learning. Other's were easy and enjoying.
