# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: November 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Introduction to TensorFlow and Tensors, explored it's basics operations: creation, evaluating and shaping.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with TensorFlow, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Tensors is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
